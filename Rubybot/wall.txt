Actually Andrew, Eurorpean chocolate tends to be less solid than American chocolate due to its ingredients. Most American chocolates are cheap and icky, due to the low quality ingredients used and abundance of high fructose corn syrup. Most European chocolates are used with more hearty ingredients, thus the &quot;less solid&quot; quality of the chocolate. A good chocolate should melt in your hand and in your mouth.

I think i got some pretty good pics of granville st bridge last night, but i am too lazy to get the camera out and check :P No he isn't blind &amp; doesn't have psyhillis??. Its a guy Mary knows from Reno that drives a Harley and he wanted to know if Mary had a single friend... Yours truely was mentioned now he is interested to come for a visit.. Mary has the same taste I do and we only like HOT GUYS... She told me he's Hot! So wether I go or not is a big issue for me.....OH and Mr. Stalker the love of my life is back doing his thing...I caught him monday doing a drive by... We gave him a new nickname.... CAVEMAN... Your Spanish would have been handy today - a bunch of girls were flirting with me / asking for cigarettes, and I was trespassing on some state-owned property for a bit too. I just played dumb American, then ran away and hid. Good times :D Close enough to what the dresses look like. <BR><BR>Ugh just spent about 3 hours getting lost in the gardens here in Sevilla. The palace is pretty damn cool. Its a shame I didn´t bring anything to download my pictures with otherwise I would show you the best 4-faced float ever to be invented. was mistaken for a Barcelona soccer player. hahaha! tell bryan i'm very upset with him. i hand carved that!<BR>actually both of those are lies. but do tell bryan i say hi! hope you're having fun over there. play safe ;) Festival of crosses? what does that have to do with dresses? So confused.... i think i found a perfect polka dot blouse to wear with a pencil skirt :P I gave the turtle keychain to Bryan today, and he loved it! Then on the way back from the big Spanish party he dropped his keys and the shell went flying off the turtle, haha!<BR><BR>So now we both broke each other's turtle keychain gifts :p<BR><BR>Hope Canada is treating you well, I will get those pictures up from San Diego when I get back from this trip. Look up Cordoba and Ferria, and the dresses. You should wear one of those. No one else would have the same dress as you ;) Awesome! You sound a bit like a MC ad there :P<BR>Glad ur having a blast. Its finally getting nice around here. And i get to grad on Tue. I just need to figure out what to wear, which is harder than you'd thin. heh. How was the Undie Run?<BR><BR>Spain is friggin hot and needs to invest in a country-wide air conditioner ASAP, but at least they have ice cream at every corner so thats a plus. Also - the bocadillo is the best invention ever. Trip is going great! Bryan is a great translator and tolerates me pretty damn well ( I was very grumpy when I got into Madrid ). The kids either though the jerky was the best thing ever, or they made the most disgusted face ever. It was priceless. Well thats not true, it was about $4.00, and worth every penny :D Feliz Cumpleanos del Cordoba!<BR><BR>Its crazy hot here right now, so hot in fact ladies are growing flowers from their heads! Hows the trip going? Having fun with Bryan? Did all that jerky come in handy? ;) Salmorejo: The greatest Condiment of Our Time? Spain! Thats what's up foo!<BR>Tapas and [horrible] beer as far as the eye can see!<BR>Wine's good though... yo yo yo sup foo hahaha hope you're having a blast and keeping bryan out of trouble!

I can't wait =) You say that like its a bad thing. both andrew...i will be a part of both. although i have a sneaking suspicion that whatever you do to piss off the locals is really going to put my spanish skills to the test. i miss youuuuu &lt;3 AWHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Checked the blog.... no article about recipe organization... :(<BR>BUT the frittatas look kinda cool. Sorry I haven't been writing... I have lost my self between training my ass off for nationals and working my ass off. I am never home.... haha! i owned that once... on my Sega Saturn! Sorry dude, I've already made a promise that weekend. Take a shot of some random stripper for me though. i see you wore that green jacket in that photo of you skateboarding! I prefer zombie Jesus!

Interview with DEATH! It was a lame-ass door-to-door marketing job basically. I felt like I was bullying the poor interviewer sometimes, he didn't even understand what a response rate was. Poor guy.<BR><BR>What the hell have you been up to? Sorry I missed you! I had a great story about interviewing with a company that basically ran a scam. It was super fun to sit through, and I got a lady to stand up and leave before she even bothered to interview. Haha, good times! gives up on marketing and is going to cook. has an interview tomorrow Hey, I'm in the library with no signal - so my apologies if you are trying to send a message to me.

You heard of Royksopp before? I know its not your main style of music, but they are my current addiction. Nope its free, I'm on the edge if I want to go or not though - its seafood and i have to skip water polo. So if you get someone else interested I'll call them up and say your taking my spot.<BR><BR>Its the San Diego Culinary Institute in the Von's shopping center at University and La Mesa. Its pretty swanky.<BR><BR>I would love to go, but I have waterpolo tonight at 8:00 so that wins ;) yikes thats pretty awkward timing actually - its like 3 days before all my exams start :S but not to worry!

I'm just glad you agree with me now that Rorschach is amazing and awesome. I will concede that Night Owl is pretty kick-ass too. Oh goodness, guess I should check my facebook more often. I'm sure we'll see each other soon and we can talk about how Ozymandias is stinky and how Rorschach is radness. Lesbian Vampire Killers.....thats the name of a movie that is actually coming out here next month.

And I'm close enough to walk to campus - but I've been working on skateboarding. Its been interesting. Lol oh ok, are u staying near the campus where rebecca and anna are? Hmm ill think about coming like in maybe 2 weekends, friday to sunday as usual lol Well I never have any work really. Mostly because I never study. So anytime works for me.

Did you get in a fight with the Clorox man? Soooo when should I come down to SD and party? Cuz rebecca is lagging it in that department lol I just realised Sarah beat me to it! Suddenly my advice feels inadaquet. Cheers Sarah! Thanx for that sneeky undercut of advice giving! snarl grrrr snarl x is becoming a master of [bacterial] reproduction Yay! Thank you, I am going to get a thermometer later today - so I can try that and see if it helps my bread making endeavours!<BR><BR>I gotta practice my British, only 85 days to go until I hop across the pond! It's important to note that, when mixing the yeast with water, the temperature shouldn't be too high or it will kill the yeast. The optimum temperature is 38C/100F. If you don't have a thermometer, mix 300ml boiling water with 600ml cold water, then measure out the required quantity of water to add to the yeast.<BR><BR>or you could just dim the lights, put on a bit of mood music, light some candles and watch them reproduce!<BR><BR>also, I like that you used the word &quot;buggers&quot; - very british :) I started doing that earlier today and I have a good dough rising right now!<BR><BR>I expect you to track down all these Luxembourgian players and see if any will give me private lessons when i am in the Euro area! haha nice, I know them all... (no i don't)! i wasn't even aware we had a polo team....<BR>also i spied your post on laurel's wall, and usually, you use warm water (i.e. 2 parts cold 1 part boiling) and then mix the yeast in. Most of the time yeast needs sugar for activation too, so mix some in. then leave it sitting, until there's about 0.5-1 inch of foam on it (10-15mins). then stir through and use!<BR> I got to see your postcard finally - my mom was hoarding all my mail for the last month or so!<BR><BR>Also check this out: <a href="http://waterpoloideas.blogspot.com/2009/02/1928-amsterdam-team-of-luxembourg.html">http://waterpoloideas.blogspot.com/2009/02/1928-amsterdam-team-of-luxembourg.html</a> You would know the answer to this:<BR><BR>What is the optimal temperature for yeast to react? I am having a hell of a time getting those buggers to do their thing when I'm baking! Another Andrew from San Diego!? Thats not allowed. Tell him he needs to change his name. Hey, how are you? I am back in the Netherlands and last night I went out and met a guy from San Diego, CA, called Andrew. HAHA!<BR>Take care! lol sure it didnt, it crosses everyone's mind now a days! even rebecca thinks im a huge addict or something lol it was only for that weekend! lol harassing fetish, i guess i could have that Didn't cross my mind actually.

Jacob &quot;imprints&quot; on their baby (werewolf equivalent of falling in love for life, even if with a toddler) :P Oh god. I hope the author continues to write about the sad existence of a highschool wedding couple and their continual descent into mediocrity.

Its like the 4th grade all over again. Except now they think boys are also cool. They're still gross; but they can also be cool. Why you can't leave any of us attended. Troublemakers! All of them! Ted, you sneaky devil you! Using the lens of my camera to sneak a peek at the lady-folk's bossoms! Why by-jove I believe you have something there! So thats how girls are made! BFF! Through extensive nintendo controller lifting I have super human strength! There is always one kid in every group who just doesn't want to play by the rules. Small snack to get her warmed up for the real thing. Album Cover. I have deemed it so. No! Bad Ted! Bad! No anal destruction for you! This is... seductive? Wha!? Is that what breeders do!? Hand of death points to communists. Allegory, or just hanging out with weird people? Cuffed and with a Fez is the best way to go through life! Tuke. Batgirl tickled me... I have been slain. Heavy sigh. Gay. Dun-ah-nuh-nuh, Batgirl! Why do I keep thinking of a bear? Why would I know where the antidote is, Mr. Bond? This looks oddly familiar.. if only I could remember... Surprise Tom! Wet cats make me laugh. Their paws stick to the sides of my face so much better when they are not dry. Matt's going to get himself a Mounty! He's friendly. Really he is. We had a lot of fun with you! Don't be such a stranger! I miss you! If you make them I expect that a representative sample will be mailed to me for quality control purposes. marrone you bastard. i will try making the scones today. well maybe. i'll tell you about the outcome later. :S Glad to be here, the food's good too.

Damn, now I have to get off my arse and do some card sending too I suppose? <BR><BR>Oh well You Canadians are totally worth it! Starting to bake tmw. :D<BR>Sent you a card. Don't worry about the slides - I keep changing things on it. What started as a stupid little project is turning into a big stupid project :p<BR><BR>Hmmm - I'll email Geoff Chan after christmas just to make sure of the days. <BR><BR>The lead was working for the county again. They promptly returned my call so as long as the budget issues don't preclude them from hiring I have a sweet job in the near future.<BR><BR>Awww, my charisma? You mean my sexy, sexy adonis-like body strutting around the pool? Hell yeah I'd miss that too ;)<BR><BR>Oh and totally rock your finals! i've heard it's feb 6-?? that weekend.. and sorry i haven't had a chance to really go over ur waterpolo slides yet. mid-exams!! i'm pretty pumped you're coming to seattle. we all missed u last game!

I should start booking my flights soon. In related news - I got my first lead for work! Nooooooo! You musn't take it passed the Canadian Seal of Customs! To do so would bring great ruin upon us all! It must stay in Canadia - where it was forged at a great cost; the cost of many a good-natured Canuck's soul! so i stole your scone recipe from your townhouse's fridge.<BR>scones shall be made in luxembourg. I will be down in SD this coming Monday / Tuesday. I have to harass the faculty at SDSU and participate in the undie run!<BR><BR>Then again around new years; Gimpy is thinking of coming down around then. i hear you're coming home soon? lets hang out! ill even make a rare appearance in SD. Congratulations! You should make cookies to celebrate! I am done!!!! :D Haha yeah it's ok.<BR><BR>But it was good hearing from you, happy holidays! Hah! Glad its helping you out. I haven't had much of a time to relax here yet - constantly running around and working. And I still have to get a house :D Twilight growing up. Looking away from the sunset. Hah - I forgot that I lived in the fog for 2 years. Crazy stuff eh? Reminds me of a horror flick - or modern art. 5 minutes after the last photo. We had crazy sunsets. Reminds me of a volcano. Okay time to leave - this place is creepy. I do miss the sunsets though. My old room. I wasn't allowed to have electricity. Electricity is the devil! I remember this place being much bigger when I lived there. My childhood home! Mom bought it for some reason and moved it 20 miles away. What we use trucks for. It took us forever to get this runway in! So much red tape and land had to be acquired. Its really quite amazing it was ever built. A rare glimpse of the sky - soo many tall buildngs out here. My childhood was stored in those two metal containers. Now they're covered in mouse shit. This is what I would see walking up to my front door. Nearest Neighbors My mom burnt that tree one night. It grew the tallest. Where I was supposed to live. Where my water came from. Funny thing out there - if the electricity went out your water went out too. We didn't have electricity for 4 days once. The entrance to a ranch. Yep, there is the house again. Looks amazing eh? I think it was modeled after WWII foxholes. Andrew, I'd just like to take this moment to thank you for your pillow. You did good boyo. Hope you're enjoying being home! Wow that sounds pretty eventfulllll!<BR><BR>But I STILL live out here!!<BR>But Lucas is buying a house in town and I'm suppose to be moving in with him very soon, like in the next month- thank goodness! dammit, why are you so cute? =) um i think thats what i was implying lol i have to say that you're a huge hurt-case for leaving so early!!! i may not even make it to the game tho b/c i have an exam till the time it's supposed to start... but if write quickly... :) You get to go for the tournament tomorrow! AAAAAGGGGHHHHH! So not fair! I have to do manual labor... hey, I'll trade you.<BR><BR>What do you say? Haha I saw your mom at the craft show and she was like aren't you friends with andrew on myspace or facebook? and I said no but I'lll add him so I did ha so how are things? I haven't seen you in ages! I don't know what this is...<BR><a href="http://www.secrettechnology.com/madethis/enemyplay.html">http://www.secrettechnology.com/madethis/enemyplay.html</a><BR>but I immediately thought of you, and I don't know why. Its odd though... Nope it means my mom needs heavy lifting / concrete pouring etc. All those fun jobs that go quicker with an extra person to yell at. <BR>I mean extra set of helping hands. hahaha construction...that can only mean one thing, that ur hanging out with sarah jessica porker lol is a construction worker for a week; Indian and cop next month. Aaaaahh... cant look at the law textbook anymore... took me 3 hours to read 40 pages :S<BR>Ur lucky to be done! Jealous. Just a little bit. heh I'm going to be drunk on Saturday. Yesterday I was just celebrating :) is diggin' Little Big Planet I went for a swim today.

As another man who can appreciate the beauty that is a machine - I got my bike back! SWEET! gooooood! glad you made it son! enjoy the sun... :) And kicking. Okay thats an exaggeration - I'm sitting and listening to music. mac are you alive?<BR><BR>(just checking) Thanks Shithead!<BR><BR>Once I get some new shorts that won't fall off my skinny ass we're going to the beach! welcome back fag! lol your excused, no really this one might be my new ball and chain :) Hah, well pardon me for confusing right now with just seeing... right now...

NO I DONT NEED A RAIN COAT OR DRY CLEANER! lmao heeeey andrew :) Wireless internet at the airport is amazing is it not? :( haha! only in canada :) I'm drinking a tea misto, compliments of Lauren! Bet you're jealous now!! misses everyone he met in Canada already. Keep ever vigilant against the Moose! this must be an extra special cappucino for you ;) Timmy Ho's...<BR>Last Time...<BR>So Sad... Hey sorry I missed you in WMX. The plus side is that I thought about it and you don't need the book for that class. Unless you really want to read for some reason. And who wants to do that.<BR><BR>Rock on sir! I'm eating at Timmy Ho's! Its right next to my gate! Kickass! Haha, thanks. Its kind of awesome to be held in such high regard ( especially from a Brit! ) I managed okay - only had to run after the 145 bus. Everything is going smoothly so far. They love me at airport security.<BR><BR>Eating at Tim Horton's while I wait for my flight. Your pillow is downstairs on Steph's bike.<BR><BR>Best of luck for finals! Enjoy your trip back to the states.. Hopefully, you'll at least miss Timmy's. :) Can't believe you're leaving in an hour. if you need any help carrying your stuff to the bus loop (hell even to the aiport) then give me a shout. Also you actually are my favourite american. hey behbeh! &lt;3 hahaha oh canada! almost makes me feel patriotic:)<BR>I'm sure you get the same sensation when you see headlines like &quot;Man Dies After Eating 231 Cheeseburgers&quot; Yep, 8 is when everyone is showing up I believe. C'mon over and enjoy the cinema!<BR><BR>Enjoying the scones is optional. yo, you still watching a film tonight? I could do with an hour and a half break if you're up for it... How boring is Canada?<BR><a href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/11/28/7571876-cp.html">http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/11/28/7571876-cp.html</a><BR>That boring ;) Hah, but you will see me again in 6 months. Think of it as a pregnancy. With none of that afterbirth mess. Gah! Sounds awesome but I'm going to be recovering from running through the San Diego campus in my underwear that day :) andrew.<BR>2 nights and you're going home.<BR>arse. i hope you're enjoying your last couple of days in vancouver, and, of course, drinking lots of tim horton's :) Oh absolutely! The last minute of it was my favourite, hands down. Soooo freaking cute. :P Isn't it amazing!? Oh, i finally watched Wall-E :D is going to break the rules. The whole orchestra. Even though we all only really cared about one of the flautists. God thats sucha weird word. Hah, who knew she could play an instrument? No seriously, if you knew raise your hand. I didn't know. Orchestra! I think this was &quot;Air&quot; Oh god. If he talked about Mr. &quot;Various&quot; and how we don't know a lot about them one more time I was going to throw my camera at him. Pub. Closed. Before. 10:00. On. A. Saturday. WTF!? I love how entranced the orchestra is with the M.C. More waiting. Stupid public transport. I'm beginning to think that maybe its not normal to see so many lights in the sky... The street where Canadians run their children across. The ones who make it across get to breed. The ones who stop the cars with their teeth get to be Prime Minister. Canadian horse-less carriages. Laurel fought off a pimp for that hat. True story. She has a mean left-right hook. The hat isn't purple because the pimp cried tears of black. Tragic story. Waiting for the freaky lights to subside. Look for an escape route quickly Adam. Chloe isn't going to stop taking pictures anytime soon. Ah okay it was Chloe. Makes sense now. Deer in headlights look anyone? Awkward..... Alfalfa of Anger! Smile! Your on camera! More feet. Does somebody have a foot fetish? Who the hell took these pictures? Stephanie Price. Woman of mystery. And maybe one too many shots. Phunny Phace! Go! Seriously what the hell? Do I always dress like this? Laurel, she's so blue. Abu-dee, abu-die. Worst porn collection EVAR! Hah, you've just seen my foot. Lucky you. *tumbleweeds roll across the landscape and wind blows in the distance* Heh. Whipped cream is amazing. I should charge for being at parties. Little Known Fact: Steph wanted to be a proctologist early in life. Russian Betty Crocker. That means more vodka in the recipes. Foodgasm! Stephanie working out the details for her white slave trade ring. Silly Canadians. Caught! Red-Handed. Those cherries stained a bit didn't they? Yep, this party sure had a lack of water polo players. But oddly an abundance of Asian lingerie models. How odd. Best Cake EVAR! Seriously people, you need to tell me when I dress funny. Its funny the first time, but thats it. Louise mid-sambuca slap. I miss the piercings I am so glad you like cake as breakfast! Now i want to bake some cookies... but paper comes first :( Try harder White man! Too bad you're leaving so soon, another semester in Vancouver (aka. Asia land) would convert you no problem.<BR><BR>Don't tell me you haven't had bubble tea yet... Because that'll just be disappointing. is not able to cash cheques in Canuckistan! Passed GO, so he collected $100 Yo! Yay ur almost gonna come back to cali! Ugh I ate so much yesterday but I didn't go into a turkey coma...I found it quite strange, anyways how are you? Happy Late Thanksgiving! I couldn't endure the ravishes of a pumpkin pie. Alas! My stomach has been a chortling Mexican tripe stew the last few hours... heh. Since its Spain do you have to eat the Turkey with tortillas? This is of course after you skewer it with a sword, bullfighting style! <BR><BR>I am now wondering - do the sequined pants make the turkey taste better? I'm glad I asianized your photographs. :) is going to party like its 999 PUB NIGHT! So many tables.... AAAAAAAHHHHH when will the tables end! Best teacher evar! hey! make sure you send that email to the waterpolo ppl! i dunno if they want to get together fri, sat or sun? HAPPPPYYYYY THANNKKKSSSGGIIIVVIINNNGG!!!! miss you crazy boy! It took 2 minutes to finish downloading that album once I got home. My browser stopped responding, but bitcommet was going at high speeds. So i am happy. heh Look babe! You too can protest when you get back to the states. =D<BR><BR><a href="http://www.daywithoutagay.org">www.daywithoutagay.org</a> p.s. tell all your friends I should be there by 10:15 so yep, see you there! Yes! I will get out of class 9:30 to 10:00. See you there? Its THE DUCK (according to you!)<BR>,&lt; Quit putting boobs on my page. And ducks too. ,&lt; (tag) Tag! ,&lt; :P is done with his presentation! 5 days 20 hours and I will be back in the states! damn it andrew. hurry up and get your ass down here so we can have another person to join us when we go to the beach. i just want to let you know that i was destroyed by a wave that will forever be dubbed &quot;the great wall of china.&quot; this is because it was a wall of water that beat me down like i was a mongol trying to invade china and failed miserably. i didnt know which way was up or down and i think i ingested some sea weed in the process. hurry up and get the hell out of canadia! Yep I had fun, and a friend came for the first part when we were learning chacha... Pretty fun then! Hope your work went well, I have my last paper to write for tomorrow and I'm way too tired to do it... Anyway hope we're having a party before you leave ;) Hah! I will be in the states - but wish you a happy birthday nonetheless! I predict a riot... So my other roommate never heard about the big party either. she has finals too. heh... this is going to be amazing :P is staring at a blue strawberry. What an interesting world. Weirdo! =P Dude, that was wrong. I cannot believe they stuffed the duck and used its corpse as practically a toy for the dog. creepy. miss you, you pain. The creation. Laid to rest. Alix, you should become a mad scientist. You have the maniacal laughter down pat. Whats this? A demon has appeared to take the soul of our sushi sandwich!? Egg Salad? Stab it QUICK! Isn't anyone going to stop it? RAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHH Sushi Totem Seriously, WTF? I totally cut of Guillemete in this photo! Sorry! Its not wasabi, its WASABI! Yep. That last glass of water did it. She's gone all tipsy now! Don't let the french have a glass of water. They start to do things when they don't drink wine. Scrambled Eggs! Me and Julia... Down by the schoolyard! Really? Crazy sauce! OMG, i cant believe neither of us saw it from the get go... its freaking &quot;Futura&quot; for font!!! :P is mixing &quot;gay bar&quot; and &quot;high voltage&quot; with amusing results. This was just so odd I had to share it.<BR><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96xRToUdzD0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96xRToUdzD0</a> Lol. That should work. Have a group meeting at 2... so we have solid hour to play around with for sure :D Those were the most amazing sushi photos :) Oh great, my group just decided to meet at 1:00 pm at the library. I guess I'll meet you first at WMX and then we can head over to meet my other group? The other project shouldn't take long - and if it does I'll just drop it in their laps. Its not like I'm worried about a grade in that class :p is going to get some sushi! Lol. Works for me!!!!! :D Okay sounds good. WMX 3rd floor?<BR><BR>I am meeting another group around 10:30 in the library but I'll have my laptop so if I'm going to be late this time I'll make sure to send you a message :) How does noon sound for another meeting at SFU tmw morning? I'll try to find a mouse... i think i'll use this in my essay on nuclear deterrence. It was started by me an Laurel. So it was a joint venture! There was no unilateral action on my part. If anything its a perfect example of the dangers inherent in bilateral actions and initiatives! i thought this was your initiative. <BR>you Americans. always starting things you can't finish. I have no idea, if you find out let me know though ;)<BR><BR>Off to swim! what time is sushi time?<BR>dude you're leaving soon.

Louise demonstrating Stephanie's greatest new invention the &quot;Chin-do&quot; I liked the other picture better.... Ladies love the merkin! With my apologies to Bryan. You can trust me! I slept in Canada last night! Fear my oversized head Louise! Fear it! Well thats a special face. Guillemette has an idea! Someone just exploded to the left of the picture. Getting my mack one with the ladies! They like to cause trouble. Busy looking imortant. Yes, all five of them. Apparently North American cheese is oily. Sugar? On a pie? Say it ain't so! Oh god, BACON WRAPPED PRUNES! Preparing food! Ahhhhhhhh! Lens flare! Chip &amp; Dale? They were speaking French. A language I sadly do not know. Much like Greek, but more French than Greek. is tired of groupwork. . I am home tonight... will start on it i guess. Home most of the morning tmw too. and Mon night or morning... not sure anymore... :S When do you want to start working on the marketing plan? thinks ethics is unethical But I am fairly Agnostic!

I'm reporting this as abuse! AWESOME! Kudos on the hair.... Keep it if you come visit family down south.<BR><BR>Yeah I don't know when in December the SF trip may happen ( of course it may not happen either ) but let me know when you want to hit up the family down south. We can run around say hi, and you can tag along when I go job / house hunting in SD. well, it depends when this &quot;mid-December&quot; is, but that sounds like a good time. i think i should hit both LA and san diego, that way i see family and friends all in one &quot;coordinated&quot; swoop! if you are basically just working all of January then i don't think that would be the best time to visit. my plan is to take about a week off of work and get out on my trip then. wants kinetic fireball incendiaries. Only because its Bryan! ;) Hanging out in WMX, welcome to come and join me ;) Movie Night! I think that is a great idea! Heh, butshot. Powerstroke! Steph is totally taking on the old man. You go Steph! I make sure to stay within arm's reach of Steph. Lack of maternal bonding on my part I think. Oh I see you Mary-Ellen. Thinking your being sly and taking pictures of all of us while we're doing busy water polo.... stuff.... I don't know what Mary-Ellen was doing with this shot. Blurrrry. But good action shot. Important goings on I'm sure. Or maybe the camera-woman was just doing a half-assed job. Gotta love our tight formations eh? Go! Go! Go! Important pep talk is going on. We're not invited. O Canada!<BR>Our home and native land!<BR>True patriot love in all thy sons command.<BR><BR>With glowing hearts we see thee rise,<BR>The True North strong and free!<BR><BR>From far and wide,<BR>O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<BR><BR>God keep our land glorious and free!<BR>O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<BR><BR>O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

I'm just trying to figure out a timeframe to get things organized. Well... I have finals from 12-13 to 12-20 and I think im flying into London on Jan 25th..thats the plan..but as of right now I dont have a place to live in London... When are you leaving for the UK, and when are you done with school / leaving the UK? <BR><BR>We have epic euro-trip planning to attend to! commands legions of undead. For fun and profit! I consider myself to be politically tolerant...</div> Hah, well at least you have your &quot;pan&quot; costume to go with your new found zombie status. Yes I did mail Louie's &quot;dealie&quot; yesterday. So he should get it in a week or two. I do not know how reliable Canada Post is. I have yet to send anything out from here. louie wants to know if u sent him his &quot;dealie&quot; yet lol, i just got a flu shot and i started feeling light headed...ugh i think im getting what i fear most...i think im turning into a zombie lol i was actually nervous to get one cuz thats what was going through my head Hell yeah!

Hey, gimpy when do you wanna come down to sunny, sunny, LA and/or San Diego? A friend of mine from the UK will be in San Francisco around mid-december and I thought about going up then to say hi to her. Casey is heading out mid January for London, and I am just going to be running around finding living arrangements and work that whole time. I totally hope so! Thats part of the reason Deanna and I could not stop laughing for a bit there :P ....ummmmm..... Please tell me thats the book she brings into class! Check out this link i randomly found.

Prove we could make it another year and didn't need to be culled from the herd.<BR><BR>Oh and get off my lawn, uphill both ways in the snow, etc. it had better be like zombie strippers or i wont like it. Okay I have seen the most amazing movie ever. We will watch it upon my arrival in SD. And you will be awed and amazed. says your cunt is like a charity. You must give, give, and give... prepare for mania! the judges hated you. that doesnt seem like the andrew i know. what did you guys do to bring their wrath down upon you. YES! I won! [The first game] then we lost to the gargantuan guys, and then again to the ones who kicked a lot. But we got an epic bender after that so it was all good.<BR><BR>And the judges hated us after the first two matches. So oh well. did you win your water polo tournament...i expect nothing more than &quot;yes.&quot; so if you didn't then i suggest you go drown yourself in a pool of your own vomit you miserable failure. haha don't be a hater andrew... What, your facebook-friends with the team before me? I'm jealous. Okay I totally flaked on getting your stuff in the mail! But by the end of this week I'll get to the post office! I have no idea how long it will take though. Hopefully the very friendly Canadians can help me with this.<BR><BR>P.S. Kids love order, run the class like a cross between Mother Goose and a Nazi and they'll love you forever. Synchronized swimming, or water polo. You decide! hit a girl. And he liked it. oh baby. sounds hot. did you join in...you know what i dont want to know the answer to that question. <BR><BR>some girl kissed me after i scared her. it was very random and took me completely by surprise. i scared he and her friends as the walked down the hall way toward me and they all took steps back screaming. when i was right on top of her she posed. looked up at me. grabbed my head and kissed me. i was so confused. I got to see a geriatric woman and an older middle-aged man making out after having a few shots in a Boston Pizza. So in *your* face!<BR><BR>Kiss from scaring someone?

So keep your eyes open!<BR> I love you just because you are you....that is all haha that sounds great, I'll let you know when I actually know the exact dates and shizz. No you may not ask. But I'll tell anyways. If you were going to end up in San Fran I was going to try and head up say hi. Grab some clam chowder or something. Supposedly its good there. sometime in mid december I think...may I ask why? When are you going to be in the states again? I read that one!!!! It was so good! :P Sourcery is also funny, but only because it has the Luggage in it. Read &quot;Hogfather&quot; already.... it was amazing. I will get there other one after i finish 3 others I bought on Sunday :P Read Thief of Time and Hogfather then. Some great lines there. But basically anything DEATH says is funny. Mostly because its true. She needs to drink more! UK - French Connection? Scaring the Canadians. Best ad for Canadian beer yet! Guy Gigi was talking about. Totally missed my face in this shot. Oh well Drunk shot! Working my moobs. Wow I am a bad photographer when drunk. Sad part is I do this whether drunk or not. Chloe and some guy who I kept pushing together on the dance floor.

It was a magic night. got hit on by the Burger King.  And this concludes our night.  Time back - Midnight.</div> Walk home. Science World. Oh and some drunks. 50% Canadian per capita. Shameless plug in front of camera End of night picture. The jacket is not mine. Yeah! Go me for cheap costume! Ruined shot of Eye Candy Hippy! Only male Ghostbuster the entire night. Guillemette working the Eye Candy. Baila mi hermana! Haha, only one of us is drunk! Okay two seconds ago those two were so drunk and totally making out. Time of day - 10:30 pm. Priceless MARIO! Very happy Alix. Eye Candy! I just wanted a picture of the Jack. Thriller! Rat Pack! I don't see a strange man behind us. Do you? Okay this is what I should have looked like. The belt is also not mine.<BR><BR>And this concludes our night.<BR><BR>Time back - Midnight. Ghostbusters huddle for world peace! Good question. Best Zombie costume ever. Shaman de sexy! never doing what again!?!? from what i see it involves u and tequila and no shoes?? hmmm LOL. Sounds like a productive meeting to me :P (Glad ur feeling better though) Hah! I totally got sick off tequila the night before we were supposed to meet, so only 2 guys showed up ( 1 girl was already not going to make it, the other got confused between the two campuses ) and I am just now able to walk without having a sudden urge to vomit! HURRAY for tequila! is NEVER doing that again good luck!!! Hopefully the group pulls through at the last min ( i do know u hate the last min stuff)... you voted eh?? just voted. Couldn't agree more! Working on my B2B presentation work right now and it just royally sucks. Still have no idea what I am supposed to be doing for this. The lines between catalogue and product keep blurring! So you did well, i did well, josh did well... and lasse is happy with the grade he got. I think this went well :P got an 81% on his country analysis! BOOYA! Never!!!! Get off your computer and pay attention. Your right. It does sound a bit creepy when u put it that way ;)<BR><BR>I havent really watched a horror film since Amityville Horror came out and I saw at a theater... It was kind of scary that we had so little work to do. You know, like in those horror movies where the really nice people lead the others out into the middle of nowhere then make windchimes out of their bits and pieces? Kind of like that. This was one of the best group meetings ever. 0 work on our part :p Enjoy...<BR><BR><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation</a> i wasn't aware you enjoyed poking women on facebook! I'm sitting to your right..... where are u? its 4:48 now!!!! and no one is here for the meeting!!!! :S You left your camera over here. Its on our microwave if you would like to pick it up. Otherwise I will be on campus in the afternoon if you would prefer to meet somewhere and pick it up. hahahahaha... indeed... it was seriously the worst movie I've ever seen. Why didn't I wait for DVD rental??? lol. Haha, the film just keeps on getting better doesn't it :D Oh my god the old guy was Freddy Kreuger!! I knew I recognised him! .... You will watch it ... the question is when ... and under how much duress ... there will be no escape!<BR><BR>P.S. Its heading over to London in December. I spread the disease! Your welcome. Dear Andrew,<BR><BR>Nobody ever liked Zombie Strippers and nobody will ever like it...<BR><BR>P.S. You never made me watch it and I lived with you for an entire year!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA Haha, yeah, I think Jenna Jameson in an interview to promote the movie said that the film was her indictment of the Bush administration. <BR><BR>I think if you want to get drunk really fast, you could take a shot every time a limb is cut off or blood is spilled. Or each time a non-zombie willingly gives herself up to be &quot;converted.&quot; ick ick ick!!! OMG, that was a hilarious movie... Especially when they start whirling around the strip pole, literally blowing all the patrons away... Also when she launches billiard balls out her pussy... LOVES ZOMBIE STRIPPERS ( and tit-scones ) Bad Movie Night i hope you plan on showing the toxic avenger at your movie night! once i mentioned mexican food, i became hungry for it and now it's 2am and there's no mexican food to be seen. talk about a major boner killer :( i think i know what the cure is: MEXICAN FOOD. I will have to treat you to the holy grail once you're back. P.S. I'm mailing your package this week. It better fucking arrive before you leave. did you make yourself sick by getting too excited over canadian hotties? tomorrow! at your water polo practice! you must get a photo! of MAPLE LEAF MAN! You going to fencing? I need to not be distracted by the internets and get some work done. And then I can be distracted by people with swords! forward that waterpolo email to me<BR>smp14@sfu.ca heya! thanks for the bday wish - my super late thankyou reply also includes the fact that my Canadian-Polka is a bit rusty. but i suppose i could try do a mean shuffle. sorry i didnt make it to yo thanksgiving thing, but thanks for the invite too - i had a disastrous amount of work this last weekend! how have ya been? fun much? :) Going to get the stuffs for the soup later today ( Wednesday ).

Tomorrow. That makes me worry for your safety and their sanity. lol ur cowboy pics, um so there is a level of canadian hotties that i just dont understand? maybe i will take a trip, right now im planning on travel to louisiana for a little taste of creole haha Haha I actually laughed out loud when I read that. That is quite the loss considering his combination of Jewish and gay powers to fail on the social graces, so I think Canadian bacon doesn't sound too bad a response... You'll just have to come to Canada yourself to fully appreciate the level of Canadian Hotness. Its like no where else in the world [thank god]! have fun with thanksgiving dinner! i'm still voting for you to just throw the 22 lbs of flour inside of the turkey! is being amazing I think I was aiming for a random Canadian but missed again. Good shot of Louise though. After the bus driver from hell finally let us off. Hotties! Tanker! She looked down. Never look down. Baby steps.... I never forget Helen! The sign warns of us the douche-nozzle bus driver. But about 30 minutes too late. Park. This was more amazing that the steamclock. Alix practicing to be a French Ninja. They are like the Japanese ninjas, but they use baguettes and wear berets. Yay for modern art! Louise is strangling some snake-like burrowing creature. I think Alix is trying to help. I stood away. Ear wax. Those strings are ear wax. Wow. The amazing steam clock. Let me contain my excitement real quick. Took! Or is it Tuk? I dunno. Hat! She's wearing a hat! Words.... they fail me here. Louise got lonely..... just realized what the &quot;instant&quot; in instant rise yeast meant is trying to tread water (not right now, but when I'm in a pool) is sleeping is watching the money markets. I may become quite rich..... is done with his market analysis is to water polo what gophers are to a field Use your judgment...you know me better than most people:) So what's a good price for it? How much will you pay for it? You better have effin bought that shit...and if you return to your homeland without it....i dare not speak of the things you will endure!!!! I just now realized that i was following the big report guideline for the project.... So backtracking and including stuff about family life :s is trying to work a cramp out of his leg it so looks like my kinda climate there haha, im watching the office and there playing basketball and its fucking hilarious and im guilty of shopping at walmart myself earlier today lol i bought a glow in the dark skeleton print shirt and some socks (i really needed them) and my super ex girlfriend for like 5 bucks I'm glad that thing posted, I was starting to worry it would not show up. LOL ur video made me laugh, i love the rain! *shivers* i just cant kick the stuff! lol i might just move to Fallout 3 Long story, but I had to clean out the dryer with a stick I found outside :) what are you doing !??? with a laundry machine !?? <BR>hmmmm. yeah, by the way thankyou for inviting me at a potentially super big party :)<BR>but I go to Seattle during this weekend plus holiday T_T<BR>have fun and C U soon ~ So, your in Canada. What do you do? Hide from the rain mostly. Coquitlam! Its where the quitters go! Consider this your intervention then: STOP DOING WOW! Lol whatever! I think I need an intervention from my WoW use Done company profile, went for a powerwalk in the rain, got some wine... starting to research the country profile :P Oh so close to the 4 solid page mark! ( single space, cause double space is for sissies and commies ) is wildly conjecturing I will cut it back a bit. But knowing about the parent company gives justification for expansion. They are growing like crazy. Sooo much money to throw around. heh Interesting, but I am still not 100% sure on how much information I need on the company. Most of my efforts have been focused on the country - and bringing a clothing label to there. Not so much on the company, past the basic information on what scale and style of clothes they offer. I got almost a page already and not done yet. Try digging deeper. This is what you should be looking at &quot;Wing Tai Holdings Limited&quot; =P I found a Members Only jacket in Vancouver. It was grey. An intense WoW session? Isn't that like getting tired form playing poker, as a sport? *yaaawn* so I see you recovered ur data, hurray! I'm effing exhausted and watching heroes, I had intense wow session lol Ugh, there is like almost no information on G2000 out there. My company analysis is so very small, like a paragraph and thats it. I am finally starting on the 447 project :P (doing company analysis.... ) has recovered his contacts and calendar! Now to finish an essay. Y'all are so demanding! I am down for Sunday, especially since that means more partying.<BR><BR>If no one objects between now and tomorrow I will change it to Sunday, same time - and make another announcement. Good point, that is a bit excessive. How about just Monday then. just for men! Sorry, that stuff was hard to do! My arms were so sore after that, and I am afraid of how they will feel tomorrow. Or today rather. I seem to be up at an odd time again. no we just watched you jump and do pushups and then dive and get out of the water. we waved but you were too focused. tssssssssssssssss I have been doing water polo, hiking around the campus ( we are on top of a mountain ) hating the rain, seeing Chinatown, doing my best to socialize, and laughing at how ridiculously easy the classes are here. Also I have been taking my Consumer Behaviour teaher's theory about how to live your life and applying it to suicide bombers. The effect being I'm using his argument to say they are living life to the fullest, and progressing as individuals. Needless to say I scare the Canadians a lot. Vancouver is okay to visit for a week or two - but no place to live. I hear closer to Toronto is the place to be / go. Bryan visited me for a week, and Gigi did as well. They are helping to keep me (in)sane! Oh and my computer hard drive failed the other day! So I lost most of my stuffs. But it is kind of nice to start brand new with my computer. Okay back to my essay due in 3 days. <BR><BR>I hope to hit up Paso sometime between the beginning of December and mid January when school starts for me in SD. Convocation Mall. Huge outdoor space. Bridge to Terabethia. Personally I would have given the tree a 10, but hey the competition was tough. Slug. Reaching out. To touch you. Touch it back. With your tounge. My own little waterfall! I should make a wish! Horton hears a Who. Big trees eh? Shrooms! And then the stump ate her. I thought it was rather rude of the stump, but what do i know. Pan's Labyrinth! West Georgia Street. &lt;insert southern joke here&gt; Ivy! But not the sexy dominatrix one. This is the one with a soul and that likes to cuddle with you. Nazi oil imports! Seriously, who in their right mind wants to put a fricken tree on top of a building with an inadequate root base! Oh wait, this is Canada. Nevermind. .... yeah he did this for a while. Major Hotty! OH GOD THEY SAW YOU! RUN! JUST RUN! AND DON'T LOOK BACK! THEY'LL HUNT YOU DOWN FROM YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN! Its very wet int his town. They are watching me..... Waterfountains, greenery, Sentry Pigeons. Okay this is more like my idea of a park. Gigi, giving a discourse on the importance of carrying a riding crop. They liked to roll. Crazy old man doing interpretive dance. Oh man! I totally missed that! Did you see my failed attempts at two goals? did his best to embarass Steph in his speedo. alix, guillemette and me watched you and steph during waterpolo for a couple of minutes.<BR>yup, we are scary. is not doing his Market Analysis of Belgium. hrmm oh wells whenever she comes around haha im watching hancock right now and i just realized this would probably be me if i had super powers, id be an alcoholic super hero lol maybe...eh! so u still in canada? I sent her some facebook messages - but no real response. I texted her a while back as well. She seems to have disappeared somewhat. hey you wouldnt happen to keep in contact with annalou would you? i tried to see if i could see her while i was down but nothing, i miss her :-/ oh well it wont be much longer til i see all you guys again right? haha LOL papi look ha! um well i got bored and felt like letting my facial hair grow, to be honest i was liking it but i just shaved cuz i couldnt handle the itchiness anymore, and either way, i can anyones papi haha ;) is recovering his data slowly... so slowly.... Dude? Working the Papi look? Or is that cholo? Canada is making me forget now.... oh god. I want nachos too. Wet, and interesting... I will give more info later! Hanging with friend right now :) lost data? oh nooooes, i did that a few weeks ago but its cuz i drank too much :-p hey hot stuff, just wait until i tell you about the place we might move into. it's kind of insane.<BR><BR>all right, bed time. Tomorrow I get to actually sleep in!!!! YAAAAAYYYYY!!!! Wet! And I lost all my data yesterday! More info later :) has lost all his data! We were actually in the deep end, about 6'8 than his 6'7 height lol.<BR><BR>Anyway, what else is happenin' now, I love working at my new restaurant job lately these days. I served Ed Harris...! He's short, but nice.<BR><BR>ps- nice water polo torso there buddy! There's the smile I know and love. What's up? Hows Canadia? Sheesh. That's almost as good as my look-of-ennui. It charms, addles, and initiates a combo with too many lows from Sophitia. pack him in one of those airtight bags, but be sure to rip the tattoo off first :) Hey Andrew!<BR><BR>Is it ok if I have some of the pictures from Mafia/cookie night? Thanks a lot,<BR><BR>Cristiana Then you are brave for being able to witness my battle-snarl! But be forewarned, once it's at max level it causes stun and me doing a major combo with Yoshimitsu. So a couple weeks ago Ted and pretended to be buoys in the ocean (in the pool); he floated for a good 2 minutes, I floated for a good 2 seconds... assuming I was made in China. is practicing his Water-Polo snarl Lauren Edwards, keeper of the sacred relic for making Teamistos. Snarl for the camera! Yes, me in all my sexyness. Eat the camera! Steph, smiling that million dollar smile. No seriously she had to rob a bank to fund that thing. Its insane. Okay seriously, I totally missed my face. Honest... Okay there we go, much better. Candid shot. Move over Heidi Klum! thank you! after the book (and, obviously, the book tour) about quintessential canadian hotness, i plan on running for vice president, because, as we all know, anyone can be vice president.<BR><BR>p.s. brahject runway is going to rule so much harder than this! Partial posting of Canadian hotties! Oh yes, fortune smiled upon me with this one. I tried to get the guy in the background in the store but it was too blurry. But then I ran into him again. Which allowed me to snap this picture, forever in the annals of history now. On a related note: OH DEAR GOD, WHAT WAS HE THINKING? is trying to mediate the salt and pepper shakers i didn't make it to the store on time today for your &quot;cookies&quot;, so you'll have to wait another week for me to get it to mail to you! :( is learning how to bake bread. Then the world. I found those on the roof as well. I think they ad a touch of Carnival to my room. Groupshot! I think she was the Angel this round. For some reason they would almost always kill me in the first few rounds if I wasn't the mafia. So odd. Evil! The townspeople. Amazing player. Don't trust him. He is a tricksy Canadian. The second Mafiosa.... or just another townsperson? Moth I found in my room the next morning. I think it is a har-bringer of baked goods. The Mafiosa in question. Daybreak, who has died? Oh yeah I know she can't seem to keep her hands off gay guys haha or anything with a penis :-p she even talked to two guys at the bar hahah, I haven't seen annalou though :( I find out when I come back next week. I have to talk to the airlines about moving my flight date up. Otherwise I'm stuck here for 2 weeks after I'm done with school. And well I'm not interested in seeing any sights around here - so its rather pointless for me to hang around!<BR><BR>Male Entertainment? I think Rebecca will be enjoying that one the most. Be careful ;) Lol were talking about ur welcome home party, when do u come back anyways? I volunteered to be the male entertainment lol maybe not just get drunk and end up in my underwear like normal lol I am a big fan of wearing underwear around the house. And then only that because of the complaints I get from less. Anyways, awesome for swimming! I just got back from doing some laps and practicing treading water for Polo. Like garth from waynes world lol I got all stiff and walked away as fast as I could, its so hot here right now haha I'm like gonna lay in just my underwear in their living room, I think were going swimming soon, lol finally! Since all the times I've been here we have never gone! Garth Status? Explain. Hmm about a day or 2's travel for a scone...or 2 haha I think I'll pass, oh man I got so drunk at the bar so did becca andrew and aj lol and I did a guy a favor by calling his friend over cuz he couldn't hear him or whatever and that was so awkward cuz he said &quot;thank you&quot; and massaged my shoulder haha so I walked away all garth status, it was alright in there, I've never seen a smoking patio close at 12 O.o Well i just finished like 20 scones - so just get the train to turn around and head up north and you can have one. Maybe two. I think there is too much blueberry and chocolate in them. I need to learn moderation. Lol I've been throwing that word &quot;domesticated&quot; around lately cuz everyone I know is in a relationship or about to start one or dating some one worth dating...eh...I must of missed when that happened, I'm on the train now and there's a lot of cute guys on, I saw one who was super cute and both his arms were sleeved up, mmm baking, bake me something! Ugh - I feel like i should do something productive right now... but i don't feel like doing work so that just leaves baking..... I feel so domesticated here its kind of sad. :( haha ur right about the explosions though so pretty :) and hey remember I'm a changed man! I don't start trouble *devious eyes* I'm not the oscar u once knew hahahahaha No, just that like me, you like to cause the problem more so than fix the problem. There are more explosions in it that way. Wait... Are you calling me a trainwreck mr marrone?!?! And u know I'm serious when I use ur last name I like to imagine you causing said train wreck. I think its closer to the truth of the matter ;)<BR> Haha so an announcement came on saying the train is have mechanical problems...damn you and saying technology will kill us all lol I'm going to die! Haha yeah right we all know it takes more than a train wreck to take me out Good thing I am a part of technology, mmm my cybernetic insides, the weather feels nice right now, orange sunset, kinda warm with a cool breeze...and some creepy business man with a briefcase and comb over not too far away from me technology will kill us all!<BR> Now I'm mobile! Haha not on the train yet, I'm waiting and watching the angels game from afar Te amo querido ;) You're coming to Spain in my suitcase in a few months. But since there is a weight limit on luggage, you need to get to like 70 lbs by New Years. You can do it, I have faith in you. And if you don't, I am taking a limb. Most likely a leg. Hmm to think, my province would consist of a lot of blood sports, mmm fights to the death! Hmm I think too many people nice will scare me, just like the first time I went to SD to hang out with becca hahaha In a day or two I'd wager. They may even help you take it over; they're so nice and accommodating. Lol so ur saying I can probably take control of a province of canada on my own? You should visit Canada then. They're crazy bums are about as friendly as your average San Diegan. Its like even when your being as nice as possible your still the baddest mofo around. Lol aaah!! I didn't see it like that, hmm go home with someone...lol well I don't find any guy in SD threatening hahaha Wha? No WoW, and then a &quot;good&quot; gay-bar? I think the world is coming to an end to be quite frank. &quot;Not bring anyone home&quot; doesn't mean you can't go home with them right ;)<BR> So I'm heading to SD this weekend, I need a change of scenery lol and becca is gonna take me to a &quot;good gay bar&quot; she knows of...hmm I wonder I will adapt to the enviorment haha and by that I mean not bring anyone home lol i cant play WoW!! lol my prepaid time is up...im a tad overdrafted on my account lol :-p LA first, then maybe Paso - but definitely San Diego quickly. I have to find a place to live and register for school! aw, that's so far away! are you going back to paso or san diego after that? Sort of up in the air - currently on the 16th of December. But I am trying to change that to the 2nd of December since my last class is on the 1st of December. I have not chugged Maple Syrup - but I did pound a Maple [syrup] Lager my first week here. It was actually quite tasty.<BR><BR>It's okay you didn't make the trip up here. I have even more reason to go and bug y'all in Riverside now ;) all of the above thanks. I hate you and miss you. i wish i could have road tripped it up there with bry but i would have taken my sweet ass time making my way there. have you chugged maple syrup yet? is this now offensive to you? haha! aww. well, when do you leave? :P hey! what's your mailing address while you're in brahnaby? yo! my extension is 11520 We have some pretty exciting dishes on our menu like the gnocchi with hazelnuts and a butter sage sauce. The people I work with are awesome and older than 17... unlike Jamba!!! <BR><BR>I think your baking skills will be just fine - just avoid blood pudding. Yes where do we get the tickets? Or can we just walk in? Eh, its not that great. I was hoping for a lot more amazing stuff, so it was kind of a let down. I found a concert I want to go to so that is going to be fun. Otherwise I'm just counting down until I can leave :p france was AMAZINGGGGGG and i want to go back! did we have a honeymoon? we should honeymoon in france. &lt;3<BR><BR>how's canada? yes!<BR>but i have this presentation due on thursday evening which i'm gonna have to work my ass off for so I'll only be available from friday 11:20 when my classes are over.<BR>but then<BR>yes yes yes I'm ever so happy I ventured into the adventures of waitressing! I need to know sooo many wines from Italy/CA, and be pleasant. Yeah! The same person who was almost invited to a bachelor party. I am going to get the stuff for bread. You interested in helping in the next couple of days? is 604.630.6000 ext 11894 My room..... I have a paper I need to have a draft of by tomorrow. But if you have a more fun alternative I am listening..... where art thou? (thats British for &quot;where you at!?&quot;) I would officially like to nominate Francisco Javier Villalobos for our Brahject: San Diego chapter. As the size of the project will be quite extensive I feel it is important to bring in competent help with a knowledge of the area. He also has his own camera and will bring milk and cookies to meetings. Long time no hear. How was France? Lol stuck in the 90's...that's a good way of putting it, I have like some friends (only online) who seem to be stuck in some sort of era like that haha, aaww so ur the coolest person there? Haha Its cold and rainy again. All my classes are boring as hell. Basically Canada is just pretty lame. Its like the country is stuck in 1990. Its kind of weird. Hahaha yup! Yay! Can't wait til you get back so that way I have an excuse of getting shitfaced in SD haha, my stomach can handle alcohol again so I'm stoked lol, so...why is it ur hatin canada so much? Lol Oh yay! I'm sorry you had to cull the herd of friends. That is never fun.<BR> hey sexy! haha i had a lot of fun looking at all the canadian pics!! lol well..i guess ur pics created that illusion, yeah im having a terrible time myself, i need a change of scenery, i dropped a lot of people who i thought were friends today :) i feel like a weight has been lifted, well since im talking to you that means u made the cut! haha ur special *valley girl voice* special ed! ;) If by fun you mean hating Canada with every fibre of my being. Then yes. I am having fun. ooh new pics, haha hey hows it going? looks like u have been having fun as well! Sorority Sluts is going to be after the Brahs. Maybe a segue of &quot;if they mated&quot;? that could be so scary. But fun with photoshop ;) HAHAHAHAHAHAH! i love it. can we mace them once we are done? i think you basically nailed all the places where they hand out but i will keep an open eye for new spots. im thinking of the bro hos. they need to be included as well. to bad your going to miss halloween down here. there are going to be a lot of sluts to laugh at...and maybe grope. Okay its the San Diego Brahject. We are going to start cataloguing the Brahs of San Diego. It will involve some photo-sniping, some direct snapshots and mostly us laughing our asses off the whole time. When I get back I am going to look into getting some generic business cards as well. We figured Mission and Pacific beaches, SDSU ( of course ) and Gaslamp. So start thinking of places where they hang out so we can get organized. is that a serious question? do you not know me? the answer to that is...OF COURSE! tell me now or i will hit you with a baby when i see you next...ok maybe not a baby. maybe a dead fish. I'm going to have to drop by one night and watch you fence then! Hey! I know you never check this, but if you happen to - whats up? I think I'll call you in the next couple of days. Canada is still pretty lame. I got my camera though. So I can put up so many pictures of how lame and wet it is here. I'm learning how to play water polo! Such an intense sport. Okay so... want to combine your love of photography with your love of making people go, &quot;what the hell? Did he just take a picture of me?&quot; and maybe through in some business cards and a ninja or two? I got my camera, and Bryan visited. So much havoc was caused. When are you and Vanessa going to visit :) is going to make it [75 days] Violets are Blue Yeah, I love you.  {Poetry is not my strong point}</div> Apparently Bryan's face now exudes the souls of the damned. Its creepy. And people didn't want to stay next to us. Weird eh? Nice place to sit and relax Wait, is this advertising what I think its advertising? I thought these were fake Yeah he makes the city cool Bryan was going all ninja on us One good ninja deserves another More library My purpose for Vancouver has been found. I can go home now. I have seen it all. Countdown clock until the 2010 Winter Games Canadian Riff-Raff. Seriously. The Library from the West Stupid Americans. YMCA! Chic Mighty Bryan! Janky shop. Way too many weapons and camo-gear for downtown Vancouver. This is the inside of a library Books from four or five stories up. and Wushu-warriors in the house Juxtapose Koi live in the pond Authentic Chinese garden Roses are Red<BR>Violets are Blue<BR>Yeah, I love you.<BR><BR>{Poetry is not my strong point} It rained two days later Entrance / Exit same as before I sat in the pagoda more Chinese garden, and completely out of order Helen, now with 90% more jumping action!

Pooping ur self eh? O.o is pooping himself. That crazy head butting sex addict movie is called 'A Dirty Shame'. and according to my friend &quot; If you wanna watch some camp, kitsch and stoooopid movies just look for films by John Waters, the fella who directed 'Dirty Shame'. They're awesome and an ickle bit odd...&quot;<BR><BR>so there ya go! i think we have at leats one evenings worth of disgracfull films to watch. is recovering from water polo Soooo while perusing the intarwebs i found this. <BR><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/8/1/">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/8/1/</a><BR><BR>Would this improve your Soul Calibur experience? is realizing water polo is an amazing workout! I'm about to go to a major international Buddhist temple. I wonder if they will bless stuff for me? Do Buddhists bless things? Sushi I have become Evil Battle-Pope: destroyer of worlds; enslaver of the meek; dancer of folk; eater of noodles; baker of scones! AND THE WORLD SHALL FEAR MY WRATH!<BR><BR>So you know, a normal day in boring Canada. I am in Vancouver! Unfortunately I do not have a student or work visa. I just came over here as a visitor since it was such a short time.<BR><BR>I was thinking more for when I get back - I am going to split my load over two semesters so I can work and get in a good financial position before I graduate. super boring? that sucks. but if i know you, which i kind of do, you'll find a way to spice things up :D<BR><BR>hey, i dont know if you're looking to work while you're over there but i just got an email about this music label type company thats looking for interns. and they have an office in vancouver. i think its marketing. but now that i think about it i dont even remember what part of canada you're in, so disregard all that. More like Ninja-Pope. I lurk in the shadows and strike quickly and silently. More cloak and dagger stuff and less smashing head in with giant hammer stuff. Unholy shoot! Will you be Evil Battlepope? What would that be? Peacepope? I'm an evil-pope in training. Just need to get my last force power of Un-Holy Water Spray. Its an acid attack that does 2d100 base damage +50 for every black article of clothing I wear. ...That hat...it is...glorious. If it wasn't for the 1,000 miles between the two locations I would so be there! You'll just have to party without me, difficult though it may be :) So I'm having the breakfast of champs, a 24oz rockstar and a menthol cigg :) I'll probably get some oj too :-p Good! The people here are so nice, but the place sucks Moose balls. So boring! But I am sitting down and doing work, so that is nice. With any luck I can get another class added and not have to spend much longer at SDSU. Of course then I have to scramble to get a job! Know any good marketing or PR firms?<BR><BR>PS - yeah those burgers were the fucking bomb! andrew...you know i dont cook.<BR><BR>but remember that one time i did and we made those burgers and avocado salsa? BOMB!<BR><BR>how're the canucks treating you? HAHAHAHAHA SWEET!!! We should room together since you will be here when I get back from London....SUCKER!!! HA is going to try out for water polo.... this could get ugly fast Well if it works for everyone we can change it to Saturday andrew what i have we told you about pulling furry creatures out of your orifices. well of course the pool there sucks. you're in canada. duh. i road my bike up montezuma. i almost died. it put a smile on my face...is that normal? hahah sounds like here!<BR>are you playing kings over there? if you do just dont bring out the whipped cream! bathing caps - compulsory i presume? The pool here sucks. And SDSU is cheating me out of units so I have to pull a rabbit and 4 units out of my ass so I can graduate!<BR><BR>The rabbit was just for shits and giggles. Yeah you need a tag, they can be found at..... the Gym of all places! Just bring your SFU ID card. Crap on a stick! When I get back I have 19 units to complete, and because of the magical voodoo that is SDSU I basically will end up doing two semesters ( 18 and 4 or 14 and 8 ) or begging them to let me do a 1-3 unit &quot;on my own&quot; study area to make up the lost units!<BR><BR>Argghhhh! This is going to cut into my running away to Spain time!<BR><BR>Oh, and the pool sucks here. For all the reasons you hate public pools. The water is cloudy.... hmmmmmmm i'll have to get a shoe tag first, aye?<BR>i gotta start going real soon or else i won't go at all knowing myself. It was so-so. The slower lanes fill up faster than the fast lanes. It is apparently pretty dead in the mornings. But then you have to get up in the morning.<BR><BR>Also I imagine as time goes on the number will decrease as people get discouraged from its use and classes. how busy was the pool? tell me tell me. also is it just random or are we supposed to fucking book a lane? I miss you so much! is laughing at locker rooms in general Matt, remember no means no. Even when they push back. Lindsey? does he have a vagina...and is there sand in it? ill make sure to be looking for you on all my local canadian stations that i get here in SAN DIEGO! moron. oh did i say that out loud. my bad. Oh man! I keep missing out on crap don't I? On the brightside I was on TV in my first class this morning. So if you happen to get Canadian TV you can see me on a segment about what you need to succeed being very quiet and silently cursing the teacher for being a man named Lindsey.<BR><BR>Practice swimming sir, for I will be doing that as well - and learning to dive! So be prepared! I was there at 1:10 until about 2:00 and never saw anyone, I was sitting just inside the cafeteria. Did we not notice each other?<BR><BR>I'm sorry I missed the hike! Oooh now I see what u mean by the way you dress now lol...creepy? Lol not really, you know it takes more than that to creep me out, I'm so excited for the weekend, nocturnal wonderland!!! Haha I haven't been to that since highschool Andrew~!

Or something, life's boring otherwise. Trust me on that one. Canada is like the states after all the fun stuff has been drained. lol no lonely as ill ever be :-/ haha &quot;you see how picky i am about my shoes and they only go on my feet&quot; yeah everyone of my friends has a man now, i literally have no one to talk to and i have no one in my life lol aaaw thats kewl swimming sounds awesome right around now id even go to the beach right now and jump in the freezing ass water but meh Bout as fun as mine - almost went on a hike, but that fell through. Been lounging around and waiting for tomorrow when I can finally swim!<BR><BR>So you seeing the prison boy now?

I am not sure I like this. Beer is expensive as well. was on a bus that almost hit a homeless guy and then broke a woman's collarbone Ya but it's worth it because they can make good scones. i'll deal with the pee for the scones. is wondering where the Internet went. Your correct it is today - I had a mental lapse. Which room / floor / house is Woytek's? it's not friday, it's today we're meeting. i think....... now you confused me.<BR>today. 8pm. Count me in! What time on Friday are we meeting? Po! popopo we're going to the campus pub place tomorrow evening if you wanna come! we're going to woytek's kitchen first. i've got sambuca. Po... Po... Po? Just watch out for the American; they are not easy to potty-train. They pee on everything. You know, to mark their territory. Filthy creatures those Americans. I couldn't get ahold of you yesterday - and besides the internet is all wonky. I did make really good scones though - banana, cocoa, and craisins. Well get whatever you want in them and bring it over: then we can make 'em. dude, you totally blanked me yesterday.<BR>me, the coolest person from luxembourg. you should be ashamed.<BR>you'll have to make some scones to make up for it. is oh so happy that the internet came back woohoo internet is back!! any word back on jobs yet? Hell yes I am up for the fencing trial! I think I'm sposed to be going to the pub with my campus orientation group that eve but that can wait till afterwards if there is an opportunity to wield a sword. Welcome to the dark side. Its hard to see, but we do have cookies. ya they are. plus they are all really young. there from a different generation so there form of slutty just isnt the same. well now that we dont have a place to throw the fruit from i dont know. i guess we could do a drive by fruiting. oh check out the song LOVE ME DEAD by ludo. its been stuck in my head for about a week. its just creepy but it makes me laugh for some reason. i think was dropped as a child...down an escalator...and they let me fall for half an hour. Damn my shortsighted nature, I completely forgot that Bryan was leaving! Neither of us can practice!<BR>Back to three. Lol very true, plus they always end up sticky....eeeewww &quot;you can normalize don't it make you feel alive?&quot; Haha listening to get innocuous by lcd sound system, so its not sunny up in canada eh? Sounds like my kinda weather Is your internet working yet? its not the same without you to randomly harass. Yes that was me! And this message wouldn't be a day late if our internet was pure, unprocessed, shit right now.<BR><BR>Oh and I dropped off my resume on campus - so wish me luck! If i get a job I can afford to do swimming, fencing, diving, and water polo :)<BR><BR>P.S. Fencing trial on the 18th at 1900 hours. You going? Oh god, are they starting up there nightly walks to the &quot;meat chambers&quot;? Are you and Casey going to finally get that fruit and break into Aztec Corner ;) I like the duality of your tattoo scheme. Heh double entendre there. Well we should encourage Louie to not leave his toys out, although to be quite fair the mounty would be glad to be somewhere with some sunshine I am sure, eh. Well... shit. Muahaha, and I practice diligently even now! The titan bomb has become second nature and soon I'll be passable with Nightmare, too. So I can't sleep lol and just got off the phone with my friend and I think I know what my right and left arm sleeves are gonna be, my left arm is gonna be dedicated to my fav marvel villains, and my right arm my fav marvel heroes yay!! I already have the perfect plan to merge them all!! My arms are gonna be so colorful, um I see louie wants a mountie...I wouldn't get him one, he only plays with his new toys once and leaves em lying out :-p You know, it kind of does lose steam. That's why you keep drinking all the way through. I haven't had the chance yet to watch Zombie Strippers yet, but maybe I can get Bryan sauced up enough to watch it again :) Neat. ;) Well I'm excited to meet them too. I've got a bunch of energy drinks and Harry Potter 6 on cd for the ride up. Should be an interesting drive. good times. the new group of sorostitutes have arrived. man this school has to many whores....and i love it. Lol yeah my distance is getting greater, since I'm active again I'm starting to get back into shape, I'm getting my &quot;v&quot; lines back on my waist and my 4 pack haha I'm working on the other 2 and my arms are toning, I don't even feel sore I actually wanna push my distance further haha, sux bout the lack of internet in canada but doing it on ur ipod shows dedication lol I said I was loving canada - never said anything about canadIANS :P. Did I imagine it or did i just see you walking through town houses? Haha! Any of the girls falling in love with you yet? I am impressed with the biking distance. The internet sucks here so I am doing this on my iPod. Damn Canada. Loving Canada! Traitor! But yeah this place does grow on you pretty quick. Remember to get stuff for the scones too; cheese and something - I forget what. is hating the Canadian Internet ( or lack thereof ) My thoughts exactly. Then I met the euro crowd and things got better. We make fun of the Canucks all the time. It's going pretty well. Currently in Canada for a semester - not as much fun as I thought it would be. And missing the boyfriend in the states doesn't help either. Oh well, at least there is cheap sushi and beer here ;) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!<BR> I see you found a new dude. How is that going?<BR> is planning a shin-dig with the euro crowd. Ummmmm I will do my best. So far no Soul Calibur is around. But I shall practice on spirit. You are all that is man. So Canadian beer really makes me burp... I blame the maple syrup they put in it..... Tomski! I lurve You! TheFurd is showing signs of aggression The cameraman has chosen a new approach Attacking the cameraman Removed from his natural habitat Panther! Here we observe TheFurd in his natural habitat Accusatory Finger &lt;insert funny joke here&gt; Back to its natural habitat, TheFurd is calm once more Just your friendly neighborhood crack dealer Demon! all is right with the world The prey Can you spot the Jesus Fish? Victorious, the hunter returns Three Muskateers Coin Operated? I don't really know May this haunt you Casey, may this forever haunt you ;) Where's Hootie? Secret code Puppy Sexy is looking for the water polo team.... Strippers, check. I'll do my best to try and find some for you. Oh, also Canadian Honey and Maple Lagers aren't too bad.<BR><BR>They also have Strongbow cider which is an amazing concoction on par with Hornsby's. WOW! well i just think i should rub this in your dirty face...the beach was absolutely amazing yesterday. the water was close to 70 because of a tropical storm coming up baja and the waves were around 5-8 ft. i road a wave that was like god punching me in the fact with a cactus. <BR><BR>im sorry that they dont seem very intelligent but i mean come on. you hung out with me and u didnt seem to care. i know the feeling of lazyness. when i was in humboldt that was the feeling i got. its like no one has a drive to do anything. its so boring. <BR><BR> i hope u can pass those hard classes though. i dont know how u will manage it but i think u should pull through. oh and if u do get to see any strippers let me know if they are any good. that just might give me a reason to come and visit. ;) female only please...unless they are really good looking men...moving on.<BR><BR>i got a mountain bike and i plan i riding it to class as much as possible. we will see how well that goes for my skinny ass. is freezing to death slowly... so very slowly It was cold enough that after leaving a building and walking 2 minutes I was shivering. I had to invest in lots of warm blankets and a new sweatshirt / jacket thing.<BR><BR>The place is nice, in that old beat-up motel kind of nice. Its not as nice and clean as Aztec Corner sadly enough. And the people! Oh god, they are nice but borderlining on Valley Girl ignorance. It scares me. There is this strong contingent of laziness that makes the US look hardworking. It scares me.<BR><BR>I hope to get a job on campus since the academics here seem to be on par with a 5th grade biology course. That and they pay up to $20 an hour. That is a strong motivator too. Got to keep those strippers happy :) im sure u will love every minute there. by the way are u there yet. u just missed out on an epic taco tuesday by the way. everyone got completely trashed [except me because i was DD =( ]. casey and annalou were both completely destroyed. casey more so than ann. wait...forget my question of are u there yet. i guess your statement implies that you are. well how cold is it. are we talking shrinkage and if so is it like down to marbles or peas? are u living somewhere nice or is it a shit hole? So Canada.....<BR><BR>Its like the US but mediocre and with friendly people.<BR><BR>And its cold. lol it seems my life always has something going on huh? well i guess it keeps me afloat hahaha aaw ur leaving :( well i cant wait for ur return! u owe me that bike ride and YOU BETTER drink and get fucked up when you get back and we all celebrate the return of baldy!!! lol oh and i met a guy on the bus who just got out of prison last week lol.... Well at least your not bored, right?<BR><BR>I'm just getting ready to leave the country in 7 hours. Trying to decide if I should bring headphones or just a book.<BR><BR>Not nearly as exciting as your life :) Suspicion is all in the eye of the beholder. Which is you. <BR><BR>P.S. I still haven't forgiven you for what you did to me with Zombie Strippers.<BR>P.P.S. And I never will. soo, my car got repo'd and my dad bailed it out but hes selling it so i dont have a car hee hee and im being forced to move out in 6 months hurray! lol anyways how are things with you? lol you would! but i was diggin the hair! isnt it fun to play with and twirl while chewing bubble gum? lol thats good to hear, my hair is neon blue right now Good, hanging out with Bryan at his work. Trying to not scare the UC kids. The hair is currently gone so I look nothing like my profile picture :) Heeeeyyy!!! Lol how are things going out there? I have your keys, should you desire your keys contact me and we can work out a safe location to deposit your keys. Otherwise; THERE WILL BE NO KEYS FOR YOU! i received a mean text message from bryan... i take it you showed him the toxic avenger? ;)<BR><BR>I bet it really meant that he loved it! just remember cactus' are not a good thing to sit on. casey is a hard man to get a hold of but ill probably see him for taco tuesday today so that should be good. well dont feel too bad about missing the beach because with the full moon the waves and tides suck. u can walk half way out the pier and and have ur toes in the water. plus the waves are weak. oh and i got completely destroyed by tequila up in humboldt. plus did a number of other random things like ride children floatys down rapids. its good times. I'm glad you agree with me on the hippies. Its been going good. Been relaxing at Bryan's hanging out and doing random crap; like checking out the botanical gardens on the UCR campus. Cactuses look creepy by moonlight. I am missing the beach soooo much! It sucks cause I will be right at the ocean in Vancouver, but its going to be way too cold to do anything! Just not fair. I will be seeing Casey in a few days - so we can cause some havoc ;) no i just went to humboldt on a road trip and realized that hippies are a plague on society. living there would be like jesus smacking u in the face with a baby. the scenery is amazing but other than that all the people can go to hell, the seventh layer, with all the gay people...oh wait. never mind. what have u been doing? hows ur boy? blah blah blah. the beach is amazing by the way. loser. has added a new bumper sticker has added a new bumper sticker Get bad bud from one or something? Or are you realizing what I have been saying all along; that hippies are here for our amusement and are not to be trusted with chainsaws? its official. i now hate hippies. has added a new bumper sticker has added a new bumper sticker has added a new bumper sticker is sitting in a chair take him! lol hes all yours! So if you threw him at me - do I get to keep him? I am a bad cousin I totally forgot to tell you about Vegas. Still not going to say much - just that Soul Calibur IV rocks and you need to make a Battle Pope character if you happen to own that game. It makes it so much more enjoyable.<BR><BR>Oh and I'm homeless until Canuckistan! I am going to be in your vicinity on Friday night, and will continue to be proximal to you until the following Sunday / Monday.<BR><BR>We should... do things... 1.800.551.1300 It is certainly possible that they are the joints of said honey-producing organisms, though i think it unlikely. has added a new bumper sticker has added a new bumper sticker Bees knees and barn raising? <BR><BR>I stand by my broken and excited English.<BR> Hmmm; you speak of an interesting subject, good sir. I do wonder, however, if they are in fact the &quot;bee's knees&quot;? i believe she is trying to say &quot;me first and the gimme gimmes&quot; who are a cover band with significant 'punk' influences. i understand they have a recital planned in the coming weeks. we should attend. i think it will be quite the barn raising. me foist and ze gimmez gimmez!<BR><BR>le yay! is winning at life andrew check out ur email u have for facebook and try to do figure out the problems. just remember...3 blind mice and when water freezes. has added a new bumper sticker has added a new bumper sticker doesn't understand how to use the bumper sticker program is really hating the DMV right now you mean like me walking around ur guys dorms with no shirt on in hopes of going swimming? :-p is planning amazing stuff Oh god, the nipples. They haunt my every waking moment! So... cold...... you... could... cut... a diamond... Lol wait...was that explaining how you saw that many nipples or ur mini 4th of july vacation Two words: Zombie Strippers. Wtf 313 nipples? Where the hell were you and no I didn't go to edc I just celebrated in spirit lol YOUR SIR....are the ANTICHRIST Two weeks ago? I forget now in all honesty - it was a blast. Total impromptu trip. saw 313 nipples in 90 minutes hey, when did you go to Vegas? I went to Vegas Wednesday night and left Sunday afternoon. I did hit up Ditch Fridays which was awesome. :D If your still in Vegas hit up Fat Tuesday's. Amazing place to get a drink. dislikes waiting to get poked EDC was a success then I take it? i am tripping balls! im watching louies house and im still on E and sweating like crazy and in his house by myself :( is rocking his speedos Haha, I thought you might appreciate this. ;D just watched an octegenarian tap dance They put bleaching gel on my teeth. Then they put a UV light on my mouth. It felt like getting electric shocks in my teeth. It was no bueno. I lasted about 10 minutes. I was supposed to go for 60 minutes. But it did make 'em whiter for a bit and I got it for free, so that was cool. Other than the shocking thing of course.<BR><BR>But I did get to see Vegas shortly thereafter. Sooo amazing. Long story too. I'll have to call you during the week and tell you about it. HEY! i read about some great laws in canada. check them out at my profile under my notes. just think you should know what you got yourself into. tell me of this dentist you spoke of!! I'll ask for pictures, someone is bound to have a camera. <BR><BR>Maybe bring you back a cave-dwelling-horror that time forgot. They are quite fun to poke. your going spelunking! i hate you! is psyched for spelunking Is the Black Beast of AAARRRRGGGHHHH included? since you already know my response, how's the weather?<BR><BR>I brought your shorts too. how bout an emphatic aye!

You can say yes, and then you can do fun stuff with me! oh noes! whatever shall i do, whatever shall i say? is getting ready to see some old friends I have your shorts and will be heading up to SLO-Town on Monday. Be afraid. Be very afraid....... No clue, this is the 302 girls we are talking about. They never can make plans and stick to a time-table. I know I will be going by you guys when I head up to Canuckistan. But if I get off the train or just hurry to get out of this country ( they let gays marry now? WTF? ) and into a more civil place.<BR><BR>Sorry to hear about your box exploding. They make creams for that, but congrats on the surgery, you did have the hair for it (wo)man. no worries about the phone, im about to change over to my new one because this one has craptastic service. <BR><BR>i have my computer now though, but that whole &quot;you screwed up on weighing&quot; deal was lame. the box also exploded apparently, so i got all my stuff in a 2 box combo with all my shit jumbled and tangled up within it. only a few things broken, nothing major so i dont need to kill a mailman...yet.<BR><BR>i miss you all as well, and if you do come near where i live on your roadtrip, i warn you, there arent any daphneas that i know of. where is it you plan to go though? I got your message about the box, but I'm a bad cousin and never get around to picking up my phone.<BR><BR>All the girls (and Casey) miss you here and want to plan a road-trip. I'm in so long as we get some Daphne's or Panda. The bag ladies just don't share my enthusiasm for mayhem. so did you watch the movie? Thats awesome. I can't wait to see you again! ^_^ SOON!
